# cpp-obfuscator

Avoid copying & hacking codes.


# How to use it?
- Open ``encrypt.cpp``, and replace ``code.cpp`` with your program name.
- Compile ``encrypt.cpp`` and open ``res.cpp`` to get the result.
- You can use ``decrypt.cpp`` to decrypt the obfuscated code.

# Note
- My code has many **BUGS**, so feel free to contact [me](https://www.facebook.com/Shitpost-d%E1%BA%A1o-100328492224653/) if you find bugs, or ask me some questions when you have trouble.
- All commands start with "define, typedef, using" won't be obfuscate, and all comments will be deleted.
